        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Our tale begins with a snow storm the likes of which this state has not seen in decades.  The kind of storm that will live on in the lore of Colorado Winters for decades to come.  I'm talking about the kind of snow that dropped ten ... maybe 12 mm in the span of an hour or so.  The kind of snow that blankets the ground with such a thin veneer that you wonder if its worth risking life and limb just to make it to the office.  The kind of snow that flees under the weight of a Colorado man's hiking boot.</p>

<p>And yet ... Mr. Plow was not deterred.  He braved this grueling Colorado winter morning to clear our sacred lot.  At the wee hour of 4:45 our very thorough friend was diligently clearing our little world here of a  nuisance the likes of which only the first morning sun could have truly eliminated.  Not only that, but sensing the the magnitude of the task in front of him, our good friend invited a plow buddy to aid in the daunting task.</p>

<p>And thus ends this chapter of The Chronicles of Mr. Plow</p>
